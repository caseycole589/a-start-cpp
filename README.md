# a-start-cpp

Uses A\* search algorithm to find the shortest path through a grid.
Need to make the board randomly generates with at least one valid path still. That is a future case deal though. This was harder than I was expecting guess I need to do some more leet code :D

Assuming your are using c++std=17
Start with

```
g++ -std=c++20 -o main && ./main.out"

```
